;; Usage:
;;
;; Only 2 functions should be used, and those should probably be bound to keystrokes.
;; Default bindings to s-m-<up> and s-m-<down> are available via duplicate-region-default-bindings.
;; duplicate-region-above
;; duplicate-region-below

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; duplicate-region is a clone of behavior from other popular editors, such as Visual Studio Code.
;; The expectation is that when a region is selected, you key shift-alt-up to duplicate the region & put it above the source, or shift-alt-down to put it below.
;; If no region is selected, it should perform the above actions on the line where the cursor lies.
;; One other bit of complexity is that it should assume the intent was to duplicate entire lines, even if only a portion of each line is selected.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put duplicate-region.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
