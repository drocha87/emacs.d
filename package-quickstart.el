Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may

the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If `default', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-x M-g   `magit-dispatch'
    C-c M-g   `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \"C-c <LETTER>\" namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

because the commit is not reachable from `HEAD' by checking out
that commit directly.  This also causes the actual worktree file

Pop a revision from the `magit-revision-stack' and insert it into

Revisions can be put on the stack using `magit-copy-section-value'

revision in the minibuffer.  By using the minibuffer history this
allows selecting an item which was popped earlier or to insert an
arbitrary reference or revision without first pushing it onto the

When reading the revision from the minibuffer, then it might not
be possible to guess the correct repository.  When this command
is called inside a repository (e.g., while composing a commit
message), then that repository is used.  Otherwise (e.g., while
composing an email) then the repository recorded for the top

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Corfu-Prescient mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='corfu-prescient-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

(autoload 'consult-grep "consult" "\
Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be
nil, a directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If
`consult-grep' is called interactively with a prefix argument,
the user can specify the directories or files to search in.
Multiple directories must be separated by comma in the
minibuffer, since they are read via `completing-read-multiple'.
By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.
Otherwise the `default-directory' is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep
input) is passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second
part of the string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is
given as the first character of the input string.  The format is
similar to Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.
Furthermore command line options can be passed to grep, specified
behind --.  The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs
regular expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like
builtin Emacs search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs
regular expressions.  Furthermore the asynchronous input split
into words, each word must match separately and in any order.
See `consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings.  In order
to disable transformations of the grep input, adjust
`consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.
